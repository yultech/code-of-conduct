# YUL Tech Code of Conduct

## 1\. Purpose

The primary goal of YUL Tech is to be a friendly, welcoming, diverse and inclusive community for the largest number of contributors coming from the widest set of different backgrounds as possible. We are committed to providing everyone with an environment that is open, friendly and safe, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite everyone who participates in the YUL Tech community to help us create safe and positive experiences for all.

## 2\. Expected Behavior

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an genuine and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the YUL Tech community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Tone on the internet is often misunderstood, and people may interpret your words differently than you might intend.
* Try to understand and empathize and try to avoid entering or engaging in conflicts.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, harmful, harassing, or negative behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants and alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct.

## 4\. Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the YUL Tech community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 5\. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible by messaging Doug Schlenker (@doug) within the YUL Tech slack community: [yultech.slack.com](https://yultech.slack.com)

Community organizers are available to help community members feel safe and when necessary engage with local law enforcement. In the context of in-person events, organizers will provide escorts when desired for the person experiencing distress.

## 6\. Addressing Grievances

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision of the community leadership, contact the YUL Tech community organizer (Doug Schlenker) and the case will be reviewed.

## 7\. Scope

We expect **all** community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues whether online or in-person including any private one-on-one communications.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occuring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
